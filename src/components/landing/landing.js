            <h3>Web Development Portfolio and Demo</h3>
            <p>This site is a sample of my work in Web Development. I employ standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in conjunction with Bootstrap and React for the front-end. The API demo section uses a Node.js backend. There is no database connected to the backend currently. The front-end is hosted on Netlify, and the backend is hosted on Render</p>
            <p>
                All code can be found on my github at there repositories !!!ADD REPOS!!!. A previous version of this portfolio site can be found at this archived repository.
