            <h1>A Retrospective on My Second Year Teaching</h1>
            <h4>By Mounir Nessim</h4>
            <p>
                As I write this, my district is in its final days of the 2022-2023 school year. This has been my second year as a full time public school educator. Last year, I taught at a high school in a different district. This year has been middle school. It should surprise no one that it has been a difficult time for educators recently. If you have turned on a TV, watched a TikTok, or read any news articles in the last 3 years, you probably have heard about some of the challenges we've been facing. All things considered, I have been incredibly lucky these past two years. This year especially, I find myself at a great school in a great district. Nevertheless, things have been hard.

                It's tough to know where even to begin. At this point in the school year, my brain is almost completely fried. This is due, in part, to the impossible workload that we face as teachers. As I understand it (I was not teaching pre-covid), the pandemic has accelerrated staff shortages in schools. It's safe to say that each teacher at my school is feeling this shortage. Every single teacher in the school has had to give up their 51 minute planning period numerous times throughout the year to cover for a teacher who has been out. This is in large part because of a shortage in substitute teachers. Most teachers have given up about 25-30 planning periods, by my estimate.

                Giving up 51 minutes of your day to cover may not seem like a big deal, so let's put it in context. These 51 minutes are the only time during the day other than your 25 minute lunch that you are not actively teaching otherwise supervising children. As a result, this is the only time built into the work day to grade, plan, answer emails, or do any other administrative work. And the administrative work is considerable. This leaves us with two unpleasant options: either don't finish your work, or do it outside of working hours.

                As an orchestra teacher, I am already saddled with numerous extra-curricular responsibilities. Some are not so bad, such as my own concerts and after school rehearsals (on rare occasion). Others can be fairly onerous, such as driving 2-3 hours out of town on a Saturday and listening to 70 violin auditions. This is on top of the standard fair. Every time we have a meeting, it takes place after school, which means adding an unpaid hour to our workday. On early release days, we stay the full length of the day (and sometimes a bit more) to have meetings or professional development sessions. Everyone is also required to serve three athletic duties outside of school.

                I could go on about the workload, but I think the point is clear. The amount of work that we are expected to do simply cannot be accomplished in a 40 hour work week. At the same time, there is no such thing as overtime for teachers. Often times, we are simply expected to work overtime for free under the guise of doing it "for the kids." As much as I love the students, I reject this reasoning. Teachers are not responsible for most of the systemic problems in public education, and our martyrdom will not fix these problems. By taking on these extra responsibilities and going "above and beyond," teachers raise the workload for all of us. When some of us are willing to stay late and come early, administrators begin to see that they can ask us to do this, and expect many people to agree.

                The work itself is remarkably exhausting. They say teachers make thousands of decisions each day, which feels true to me based on my experience. Even a small group of kids requires a huge amount of attention and monitoring. Large classes full of energetic students can cause a serious sensory overload. Many students feel entitled to your time and attention. I have implemented a rule that I will probably use for the rest of my teaching career: I do not answer questions that begin with "what if." Middle schoolers have a real knack for thinking up every possible off-the-wall scenario. As cute as it can be, it's also incredibly draining. Behavior is also a near-constant issue for some students. Managing all of this while trying to deliver instruction in a fun and engaging way is quite the juggling act.

                What discussion of workload could be complete without addressing pay? I have a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which is closely related to my content area. Unfortunately, North Carolina does not pay more for advanced degrees if you started them after Fall 2013. Supposedly, my county will reinstate advanced degree pay next year. The difference is only about $5,000 per year. I'm also licensed to teach in Georgia, where I might be making up to $20,000 more per year depending on the district. I don't think a single employee at my school lives in the wealthy suburb of Raleigh in which we're located. It's simply not affordable. Most of us are driving 20-60 minutes to get here each day. Nobody gets into teaching for the money, but it's a sad state of affairs when teachers cannot afford to live in the community where they teach.

                One talking point that you encounter frequently as a complaining teacher is "at least you get summers off!" It seems to me that everyone should already know this, but we do not, in fact, have summers off. We are unemployed during the summer. This does mean that we do not have to go to school, but we also do not get paid. It should be common knowledge that many teachers take summer jobs to help make ends meet.

                You may be thinking that this is an awful lot of complaining about teaching. If it's so bad, why continue to do it? Well, that's a very valid question. There certainly is a great deal of satisfaction that comes from working with kids. Whether it's being a positive role model for kids, providing a safe place for them, or simply seeing something click for the first time, it can be quite rewarding. At the same time, I get the sense that many teachers are still teaching simply because a better alternative has not presented itself to them. Some colleagues have told me as much.
