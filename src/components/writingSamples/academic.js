            <h5>Abstract</h5>
            <p>
            The viola came to prominence as a solo instrument relatively late compared to the violin
and cello. As a result, the standard repertoire is more recent, consisting largely of twentieth
century works. The standard repertoire continues to expand as new works are written and
embraced by performers. One such work is the Hungarian composer György Kurtág's open
ended collection of pieces for solo viola Signs, Games and Messages (1987-). Kurtág, born in
1926, is one of the most important composers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. His
music is characterized by its brevity, fragmentation, ambiguity, and intertextuality. The
painstaking scrutiny Kurtág applies to his own compositions results in a dense web of musical
and extramusical references. Although Kurtág only achieved international acclaim late in his
career, he has since been recognized as a profound and influential voice in Hungarian music and
in contemporary music more broadly. Signs, Games, and Messages, an important contribution
to the literature for unaccompanied viola, is a collection of short pieces that exemplifies many
of Kurtág's stylistic traits. This paper will examine eight of these works that represent a crosssection of the composer's tendencies: Jelek II, Perpetuum mobile, Panaszos nóta, The Carenza
Jig, Hommage à John Cage, In memoriam Blum Tamás, Kroó György in memoriam, and Samuel
Beckett: le nain. Due in part to the brevity of these pieces, their full context and meaning are
not readily apparent, requiring close examination on the part of the performer. Through
comparison with Kurtág's other works, biographical study, and musical analysis, these pieces
can be better understood and performed.

            Although Jelek II does not fit into any conventional musical form, it can be understood as
four phrases, each separated by a rest and differentiated by a change in musical material. The
opening and closing phrases of the piece are linked through the implication of poetic feet as
well as contour, gesture, and pitch content. Both lines are characterized by forte staccato eighth
notes and large intervallic leaps by dissonant intervals. The first eleven notes of both phrases
imply a twelve-tone row inverted in the latter phrase. In both phrases, the twelfth note is a
repeated note instead of the one remaining pitch. Each missing pitch is emphasized later in the
phrase after some intervening pitches. The complete row is as follows: D, C-sharp, A, G-sharp, Bflat, G, F, F-sharp, D-sharp, E, C, B. Kurtág delays the B in the first phrase by one note. Despite
the interruption, the B is emphasized with the only tenuto accent of the phrase. The inversion of
the row that appears in the final phrase is as follows: D, E-flat, G, G-sharp, A, B, B-flat, D-flat, C,
E, F. Again, the final pitch is delayed and emphasized. The F is the final note, as well as the
highest pitch of the phrase and is approached by a nearly three octave leap. This fleeting use of
serialism appears in Kurtág's other early works in a less strict and pervasive way than the works
of Webern or other serial composers.
